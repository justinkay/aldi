Renamed the csv-file "30-06-22 NARS-30 flash off_csv(1).csv" to "300620 NARS30 Flash off_csv.csv" to use in the dataset. This is the only annotations for WWH fields (LG-WWH-NARS30).

Renamed the csv-file "150620 LSE3 Flash on.csv" to "150620 LS3E Flash on.csv" - the LSE3 was clearly a type for the correct camera name, which is LS3E.
