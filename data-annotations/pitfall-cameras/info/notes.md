Renamed the csv-file "30-06-22 NARS-30 flash off_csv(1).csv" to "300620 NARS30 Flash off_csv.csv" to use in the dataset. This is the only annotations for WWH fields (LG-WWH-NARS30). There is a "skip" in the annotations compared to the uploaded files, i.e. there are some annotations missing for a range of the images in the "middle" of the folder. It's okay in terms of our dataset though, because these images will simply not be recorded in the COCO-JSON annotations.

Renamed the csv-file "150620 LSE3 Flash on.csv" to "150620 LS3E Flash on.csv" - the LSE3 was clearly a type for the correct camera name, which is LS3E. 

The originals-converted annotations have filenames that match the prefix used for the files they are annotating.
